Topic: client and server software design using sockets
1. Write TCP client and server programs in Python that the client sends a set of integers that representyears to the server. The server receives the set, checks whether each integer (year) is a leap year or not, and sends the result back to the client. The client then receives the resultsand prints it out. You should test your program for differenttestcases.
2. Repeat problem # 1 using UDP client and server programs.
Note: Client should read testcases line-by-line from a file placed in the same folder as the client. As an example of a line would be:2000 2019 2020 2021 2022 2024 2100
